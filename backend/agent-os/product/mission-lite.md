# Product Mission (Lite)

Charlotte UDO Backend is a Directus CMS backend that empowers Charlotte city staff to efficiently manage and publish zoning and land development regulations, while providing developers, property owners, and citizens reliable API access to critical regulatory information through a modern headless CMS architecture.

Charlotte UDO Backend serves city planning staff who need to maintain accurate regulatory content, and developers who consume this data through APIs. Unlike generic Directus installations, our backend is specifically optimized for government regulatory content management with custom collections, Render-optimized deployment workflows, and curated extensions including AI assistance for content management.
