> Spec: Safe Production Deployment Workflow
> Created: 2025-08-12

## Overview

Implement a safe deployment workflow that preserves all production data, user-uploaded files, and database content while deploying code changes, custom extensions, and platform updates to the Directus production environment. This solution will eliminate data loss during deployments and ensure production continuity.

## User Stories

### Production Deployment Without Data Loss

As a developer, I want to deploy code changes to production, so that I can update the platform without losing any production data, user content, or uploaded files.

The workflow should allow me to push all code changes including custom Directus extensions, platform configurations, and schema updates while preserving all production database content, user-uploaded images, and files. The deployment process should be automated, reliable, and include rollback capabilities if issues arise.

### Content Team Continuity

As a content team member, I want my work preserved during deployments, so that I don't lose articles, media files, or any content changes I've made in production.

When developers deploy updates, all my uploaded images, created content, and database entries should remain intact. The deployment should be transparent to me - I shouldn't notice any data loss or need to re-upload files after an update.

## Spec Scope

1. **Backup System** - Automated backup of production database and files before deployment
2. **Selective Deployment** - Deploy only code changes while preserving production data
3. **Asset Preservation** - Maintain all uploaded files and images during deployment
4. **Extension Sync** - Deploy custom Directus extensions without data loss
5. **Rollback Capability** - Ability to revert deployments if issues occur

## Out of Scope

- Migration of development content to production
- Changes to production database structure that would require data migration
- Backup retention policies beyond immediate deployment needs
- Multi-environment deployment orchestration

## Expected Deliverable

1. Scripts that safely deploy code to production while preserving all data
2. Automated backup process that runs before each deployment
3. Verified preservation of all production images, files, and database content after deployment
